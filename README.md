Plot the following in the same figure and compare the results to each other. Assume that the incoming flow’s static pressure and temperature are P1 = 1 atm, and T1 = 298.15 K, respectively. Use the calorically perfect gas assumption with γ = 1.4.
a)	Following the discussion in Section 4.6, calculate and plot the pressure on a 5° half angle cone in air using the small disturbance theory, for upstream Mach numbers (M1) 4 to 20 with Mach = 1 increments. This problem will require you to solve Equation 4.106, using the appropriate boundary conditions.
b)	Following the discussion of Chapter 10 of Anderson’s “Modern Compressible Flow” book, calculate and plot the pressure on a 5° half angle cone in air using the inviscid exact theory, for upstream Mach numbers (M1) 4 to 20 with Mach = 1 increments. This will require you to solve Equation 10.13 with the appropriate boundary conditions.
